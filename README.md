Simulating the latent cause model requires both "imm_localmap.m" and "imm_run.m" shared on https://github.com/sjgershm/memory-modification.git

The former is slightly modified for our experimental design, and shared on repositry here.

The latter can be taken from the original github repositly.

For an example of input data, see csv file.
