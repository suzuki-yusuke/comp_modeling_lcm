Simulating the latent cause model requires both "imm_localmap.m" and "imm_run.m" shared on https://github.com/sjgershm/memory-modification.git

The former is slightly modified for our experimental design, and shared on repositry here.

The latter is referred to the original github repositly.

For the estimation of histogram bin width (Shimazaki and Shinomoto, 2007), sshist_v2.m, is reffred to the author's site https://s-shinomoto.com/histograms/

For an example of input data, see csv file.
